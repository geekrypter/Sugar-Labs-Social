# Sugar Labs Social

It's a social website that can be used to attract maximum users and everything ( Blogs, New projects, Software, Activities, etc), users can upload on it which will attract more users and create their interest. A competitive proposal must include some evidence that the approach taken will result in some use and just because we build it doesn't mean they will come.
