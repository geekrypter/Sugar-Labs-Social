# Sugar Labs Social
## Brief explanation
Sugar Labs Social is a website project which should serve a purpose to help people understand and discuss project(s) around Sugar Labs.

It's a social website that can be used to attract maximum users and everything ( Blogs, New projects, Software, Activities, etc) can be uploaded on it which will attract more user and create their interest. A competitive proposal must include some evidence that the approach taken will result in some use and just because we build it doesn't mean they will come.
